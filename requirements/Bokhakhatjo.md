Item System.

<h1>Detailed Requirements</h1>

We will make it so that enemies drop items when killed. These items include debuff items and buff items. Buff items consist of explosives, a three-round burst gun, and a fire rate increase. Debuff items include stat reductions (attack speed, movement speed), stun, weapon deletion, and reverse movement direction.
