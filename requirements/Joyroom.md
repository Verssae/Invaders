## Dependencies on Other Teams

The following are three things to ask other teams for two player mode. First of all, we need a 2P mode selection on the start screen. There is a need to proceed with the individual exhibition and 2P selection on the main menu. Therefore, we will ask the main menu to create a 2P-only play button that is distinct from the basic play. Second is 2P Level Design. In order to differentiate it from individual play, a separate level design of 2P is required. Last is dedicated HUD. As there are two players on one screen, a different format of HUD is needed than in individual games.
